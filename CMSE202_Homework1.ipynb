Once the researchers have done this, they will resort to helping out the developers when they need help debugging. The developers will have a few roles within it, that being each team will tackle a certain goal in the project. Everyone will commit their changes to Git by the end of every day we work on it, including comments about what changes were made. Proper coding standards will be expected, including comments on what each code chunk does, important variables, etc. The requirements for commit messages are not too high, as the code should have comments about what each line does specifically. The message should include an overall idea about what was done, it doesn't need to include every line you coded. Eventually, everyone will have committed their portions to the Git repository. The lead developers will ensure the entire code works properly. Debugging will occur through communication of the lead developers and debugging work will be handed out accordingly. The method I propose would mean using branches."

    "<font size=+3>&#9998;</font> Debugging is the process in which we fix code. In essence, whenever we write code, we have to make sure each part of the code works. Lets say we are writing a function that tests whether a number is even or odd. Again, lets say that we input the number '2' into this function. It should return a response indicating that it's even, right? Well, what if it didn't, and it returned saying it's odd, or possibly it threw an error message. Debugging is all about understanding these errors and misvalues. Now we can go through line by line and see what each line of code is doing. If we see a mistake, we fix it then check to see if the function works. \n",

    "My general debugging process starts with running the code first. I need to know the ouput in order to know what I'm looking for, assumingly I know what the functions are supposed to do initially. Otherwise, I'd make sure I know what I'm trying to solve. Afterwards, I'd have two issues I could run into:\n",

    "The first is that there is an error message. The error message could vary from an out of range error, to an exception being thrown, and so on. More often than not, copying and pasting the error into Google will help you out. It will point you in the direction of what is causing it. From there, go through any loops or exceptions and see what line needs to be changed.\n",

    "The other one is a bit more tricky. The code will run, but you will get a different output than what you desired. For example, if you have a function meant to calculate a 2% increase in profit over 'x' years, you have to make sure you know what output you're looking for otherwise the answer could be something completely different than what you actually need. \n",
